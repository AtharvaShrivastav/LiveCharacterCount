Live Character Count Project Documentation
Overview
The “Live Character Count” project is a simple web page that dynamically displays the number of characters (including spaces) as a user types into an input box. By combining HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, we create an interactive experience that provides real-time feedback to users.

Technologies Used
HTML: Defines the structure of the page.
CSS: Styles the elements, including the input box and character count display.
JavaScript: Handles user input and updates the character count dynamically.
Project Components
index.html:
Contains the basic HTML structure.
Includes an input box for user text entry.
styles.css:
Defines the visual appearance of the page.
Styles the input box and character count display.
Ensures responsiveness for different screen sizes.
script.js:
Manages interactivity:
Selects the input box using document.querySelector.
Adds an input event listener to track user typing.
Calculates the character count (including spaces).
Updates the display dynamically.
Implementation Steps
HTML Setup:
Create an index.html file.
Add an input box with an appropriate placeholder (e.g., “Type here…”).
CSS Styling:
Create a styles.css file.
Style the input box (size, font, colors).
Position the character count display (e.g., below the input box).
JavaScript Logic:
In a script.js file:
Select the input box using document.querySelector.
Add an input event listener to the input box.
Inside the event handler:
Retrieve the input value.
Calculate the character count (using .length).
Update the character count display.
User Experience Enhancement:
Consider adding visual cues (e.g., changing color when nearing a character limit).
Handle edge cases (e.g., handling pasted text, handling special characters)
